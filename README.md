# RC_Sounds
A simple, low cost sound effect module for R/C vehicles, land or water based. It utilises a DF Robot DFR0299 MP3 module to continuously play a selected MP3 sound file. A Microchip ATTiny85 provides MP3 control functions, error handling and can support two servo PWM inputs. A set of 4 switches are used to provide easy selection of the desired sound sample. Using one of the PWM inputs, a horn/siren sound can be overlaid and once it finishes playing, normal sound resume. The horn/siren setting is programmable to allow for different receiver outputs.

A PAM8403 Class D amplifier, with EMC fixes is also provided, this allows the system to drive 2x 8 ohm speakers at 2W. Volume control is provided on-board as well as an option to mute the amplifier and finally use an external amplifier, if desired using the pre-amp outputs.

PCB designed to fit into a Hammond 1594B enclosure.

Total cost of all parts, PCB, enclosure and speakers is approximately Â£30.

Current state as of 11th April 2021.
Design is working well. Had to wire link the first PCBs as the switch inputs were not connected to an analogue input. The Schematic and PCB shown here are the corrected files.

The first software release is attached to the repository. The software is written in the Arduino IDE, it uses the ATtinyCore library and the Optiboot bootloader. The board must be programmed using a progammer, I use a USBASP. To allow the PWM settings function to work, you have to disable the reset function on the fuses. A high voltage programmer is required to unlock. I use this design, https://github.com/wokwi/attiny-hvsp-programmer and clip onto the ATTiny85. All fuse setting defined in the software.

Power is from a 3.7-12V supply or the receiver BEC circuit. Unit has a polyfuse to protect against reverse polarity and a linear regulator.
